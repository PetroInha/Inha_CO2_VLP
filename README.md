# Inha_CO2_VLP
 developing a Python-based Equation of State (EOS) for CO2 that considers different temperature and pressure conditions, encompassing gas, liquid, and supercritical phases. Our ultimate goal is to create a vertical lift performance (VLP) for CO2 injection in subsurface environments, accommodating any surface conditions of CO2.
